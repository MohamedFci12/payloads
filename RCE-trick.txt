Project Started:
1. Port Scanning IP Address [Found open SSH but not vulnerable + brute forcing password didn't work].
2. Performed Reverse IP Address [Found the Domain Name].
3. Performed Subdomain Enumeration [Found a Resolving Subdomain `vip.target.com`].
4. Port Scanning [Found Nginx, Xampp, Java Running].
5. Checking for common vulnerabilities and well known exploitations [None was vulnerable to CVE].
6. Directory Brute Force [Found Login Page].
7. Trying common usernames and Brute Forcing password input [Didn't work].
8. Viewing Page Source + Reading JavaScript Files [Found hidden Registration Page].
9. Registration required Whitelisted Range of Phone Numbers.
10. After several tries, Found the phone number pattern.
11. Verification code is sent to the phone number and it is required in order to register [Problem is that I don't have access to the phone number that I added and can't add different pattern].
12. Intercepting requests and responses, I found a vulnerability in the Phone Number Verification Process [Verification Code is being Leaked in the Response].
13. Confirmed the verification code and registered successfully.
14. Navigated to Login Page (Required Username and password to Login).
15. Unable to Login [Response Message: Username is not Valid (Knowing that I used the same username in registration)].
16. Added the registered phone number instead of the username [Logged In Successfully].
17. Server is running Xampp. I searched for File Upload endpoints [All picture uploads were validated and protected].
18. After 2 hours of browsing the dashboard and checking every single functionality, I found an endpoint that is missing to validate the upload icon extension.
19. Uploaded php reverse shell and navigated to the directory where it is stored [Shell didn't execute and PHP wasn't rendered in the page].
20. Checked the requests and found (.do) in the request URL [Although application is running Xampp, But it is using Java in the backend].
21. Wrote simple jsp reverse shell, Then uploaded it.
22. I got Remote Code Execution (RCE) and accessed the server as Administrator.
23. All done within 4 Hours.

RCE is not just a bug, it is a mindset.
